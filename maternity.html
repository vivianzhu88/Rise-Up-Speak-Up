  <h2> Did You Know? </h2>
  <p> Only 12% of civilian employees had access to paid family leave in 2013. </p>
  <h2> Your Rights </h2>
  <p> The Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) of 1978 does not allow discrimination based on pregnancy. It mandates that women who are affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions must be treated the same as workers who are similarly affected regarding all employment-related purposes, including benefits for jobs. The law applies to employers who have fifteen or more employees, as well as employment agencies and labor organizations. It provides: </p>
  <ul id = "list">
    <li> Freedom from harassment or discrimination based on pregnancy or a related condition (including miscarriage, pregnancy termination, recovery from childbirth, and lactation). </li>
    <li>Equal access to job modifications. </li>
    <li>Freedom from being "pushed out" of the workplace because of pregnancy, childbirth, or lactation. </li>
    <li>Health insurance coverage for pregnancy-related conditions, as long as the employer provides coverage for other medical conditions. </li>
    <li>The right to the same treatment as other employees, including temporarily disabled employees. </li>
  </ul>
  <p> The Nursing Mothers Provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act require that covered employers provide employees with the right to pump breast milk at their job. It applies to employers involved in interstate commerce with a gross revenue is at least $500,000 per year. Employers with fewer than fifty employees are able to seek exemption from the break time requirement if complying with the provision would create undue difficulties. Only non-exempt (generally hourly) employees are covered under the Nursing Mothers Provision. It does the following: </p>
  <ul id = "list">
    <li>Grants reasonable break time to pump breast milk for a nursing child for one year after the child's birth as well as a place, other than a bathroom, that is shielded from view and free from intrusion. </li>
    <li>Protects workers from retaliation (such as reassignment to a less wanted job, taking away job duties or benefits, or firing) for asserting their rights or filing a complaint about these issues, if they seek to assert these rights on the job. </li>
  </ul>
  <p> However, be aware that the legislation above has helped, but the vast majority of pregnant women must follow with company policy, which varies greatly. </p>
  <h2> Speak Up! </h2>
  <p> Dear [employer/human resources], </p>
  <p> I am writing to inform you of my pregnancy and my intention to take the allotted 12 weeks of maternity leave available to me. I intend to start my maternity leave on [date] and return to the office on [date], barring any unforeseen issues with my pregnancy and delivery. </p>
  <p> I intend to make every attempt to complete priority projects before my maternity leave begins. I should be able to check in periodically from home. I will do my best to make up for any important project or client developments I missed when I return to work. I intend to delegate some of my responsibilities to [the Assistant Supervisor] who works with me in my department during my maternity leave for your added convenience. </p>
  <p> If my plans change for any reason, I will let you know as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for allowing me time away from the office so that I may prepare for the birth, bond with my child, and adjust to life as a new mother. The required maternity leave form is attached, along with a letter from my doctor confirming my pregnancy. Please contact me if you need any additional information or clarification. </p>
  <p> Sincerely, </p>
  <p> [Name (Signature)] </p>
  <p> [Name (Typed)] </p>
